Aws - Amazon web Services - Cloud Services

It lets you-

1. Rent Servers
2. Manage Domains
3. Upload Objects (mp4 files, jpgs, mp3s)
4. Autoscale Servers
5. Create k8s clusters


--------------------
Here, we will be discussing about Renting Servers.

## EC2 Servers

VMs (Virtual Machines) on AWS are called EC2 Servers.

EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Version 2.

1. Elastic - Can increase/decrease the size of the machine.
2. Compute - It is a machine


-----------------------
We can spin up a new instance of EC2 from AWS dashboard.

Here, we've created a ubuntu Server manually from ec2 dashboard.

now, open any folder, and paste your created key.pem .
now, run command to connect to the server:

ssh -i vishnu-backend-server-1st-keypair.pem ubuntu@44.203.198.107

*vishnu-backend-server-1st-keypair is a .pem filename
*ubuntu@publicIP of your instance.

-- it might say:
```
