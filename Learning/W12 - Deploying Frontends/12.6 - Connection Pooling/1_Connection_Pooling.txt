In my words, 

The Connection of database with each worker can't be established efficiently, each connection will break and 
connect again, 

So, there will be a Connection Pool, which will connect the workers to the database. so worker won't lose access.


Go through this doc : https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-cloudflare


This doc, is basically tell to connect a db with cloudflare worker. 
no connection pooling is done here, it is already handled by neondb(the postgres db provider)

However to do connection pooling manually for production level stuff:

IF you're usign prisma with Postgres, then use Prisma-Accelearate.
If you're using just Postgres, then use pgBouncer. 

---- In details here it is ---------

Connection pooling is a technique used to manage database connections efficiently by reusing a pool of 
pre-established connections rather than creating and destroying connections repeatedly for each query. Letâ€™s break 
it down for **Cloudflare Workers** and **Prisma (PostgreSQL)** specifically:

---

### **1. Cloudflare Workers**
Cloudflare Workers run in a **serverless environment**, which poses challenges for traditional database connection 
pooling. Here's why:

- **Stateless nature**: Each request may run in a separate instance of the Worker, which cannot share persistent 
connections between instances.
- **Connection limits**: Cloudflare Workers cannot maintain long-lived TCP connections due to the way they handle 
networking.

#### **Solution for Connection Pooling**
In serverless environments like Cloudflare Workers, traditional connection pooling is often replaced by 
**connectionless architectures** or **serverless database proxies**:
- **Tools like Prisma Data Proxy or pgBouncer**:
  - These sit between your worker and the database, managing connection pooling on behalf of the Worker.
  - They open persistent connections to the database and efficiently share them across incoming requests.

- **Serverless-compatible databases**:
  - Use **PostgreSQL-compatible serverless databases**, such as **PlanetScale**, **Neon**, or **Supabase**, which 
  optimize for stateless environments by implementing their own pooling mechanisms.

### **2. Prisma with PostgreSQL**
Prisma is a modern ORM for databases, including PostgreSQL. When used in traditional environments, Prisma handles 
connection pooling via its **Prisma Client** and underlying database driver. However, in a **serverless context**, 
some adjustments are required:

#### **Traditional Connection Pooling**
In a non-serverless setup:
- **Connection Pooling** is achieved using drivers like **pg-pool** (for PostgreSQL).
- A fixed number of database connections is maintained, and these connections are reused across requests, improving 
performance.

#### **Serverless Challenges with Prisma**
- **Excessive connections**: Each invocation of a serverless function could create a new connection, quickly 
exceeding database connection limits.
- **Idle connections**: Since serverless functions are short-lived, connections might remain idle and unused, 
wasting resources.

#### **Solutions for Prisma in Cloudflare Workers**
1. **Prisma Data Proxy**:
   - Prisma provides a **Data Proxy** specifically designed for serverless environments.
   - It handles connection pooling by maintaining long-lived connections outside of the serverless function and 
   sharing them efficiently.

2. **PgBouncer**:
   - If you manage your own PostgreSQL instance, **PgBouncer** can act as a lightweight connection pooler to manage 
   connections between your Prisma client and the database.

3. **PlanetScale/Neon**:
   - Switch to serverless-compatible PostgreSQL databases that abstract away connection pooling and scale 
   automatically for serverless workloads.

4. **Short-lived Queries**:
   - Minimize connection time by ensuring each query is short-lived and connections are closed immediately after 
   execution.

### **Best Practices for Both**
- **Use a serverless database proxy**: For Cloudflare Workers and Prisma in serverless environments, this is the 
most reliable and scalable solution.
- **Optimize database connections**: Use tools like **PgBouncer**, **Data Proxy**, or **native serverless 
databases**.
- **Connection limits**: Monitor and configure your database's connection limits to avoid bottlenecks.
