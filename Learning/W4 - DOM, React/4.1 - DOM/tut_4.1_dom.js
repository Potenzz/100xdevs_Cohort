// DOM - Document Object Model - The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a web document in memory. It allows programs to change the document's style, content, and structure.


// BackStory :

// By the gemini ai:
// ECMA : sets the standard for JavaScript. Â  
// V8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine that implements the ECMA standard which is made for chromium browsers
// Node.js is a runtime environment that uses V8 to execute JavaScript code on the server-side.


//By my language:
// What is Javascript : Javascript language was an implementation of ECMA script.
// But for some extra functionality we got Node.js - which is a runtime and can compile extra functionalities like setTimeout, fetch , setInterval.
// And for some other functionalities we got Browser engines(like V8) like  Document.
